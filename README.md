# WarVessels
## Java Terminal UI game

In this game two players will face off against each other on the open field separated by great lengths. Players will not be allowed to see each other's pieces, and will have to launch their artillery at the other player in hopes that it hits a target.

## Game initialization

Players will connect with each other over the local network. At the start of the game they'll be presented the option of creating a lobby or joining one from a list of existing lobbies on their local network. Once joined they both have to mark themselves as ready before entering the war room.

## War room
Both players are now in charge of their fleet and must decide on vessel placement. After both players place their vessels on the field they shake hands and agree to go to war ðŸ¤£

## Showtime

Players take turns launching artillery at the enemy territory. If a player successfully lands a hit they are notified of the coordinates which landed successfully. Once all of a player's war vessels are destroyed the other player is declared victorious.
